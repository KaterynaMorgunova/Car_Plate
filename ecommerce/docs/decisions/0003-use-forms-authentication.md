# Use Forms Authentication

## Context and Problem Statement

To determine the authentication mechanism for the application, we evaluated the use of Forms Authentication and LDAP.

## Considered Options

* Forms Authentication: A method that allows users to authenticate using a username and password stored within the application's user database.
* LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol): A protocol used to access and authenticate users against a centralized directory server.

## Evaluation Criteria:
* Security: The ability to provide a secure authentication mechanism.
* Integration: The ease of integrating the authentication mechanism into the application.
* Scalability: The ability to handle a growing number of users and provide efficient performance.
* User Experience: The overall experience for users during the authentication process.
* Maintenance: The effort required to maintain and update the authentication mechanism.

### Forms Authentication
1. Simplicity: Forms authentication is relatively simple to implement and manage within the application.
2. Customization: It allows for greater customization of the authentication process, including password policies, password recovery, and user registration.
3. Flexibility: Forms authentication can be used with various data sources, such as a SQL Server database, making it easier to adapt to different environments.
4. User-Friendly: Users are familiar with the standard username/password form, resulting in a straightforward and intuitive authentication experience.
5. Access Control: It enables fine-grained access control by integrating with role-based authorization mechanisms, allowing for granular permission management.
   
### LDAP	
1. Centralized Management: LDAP provides a centralized directory server, making it easier to manage user accounts and access permissions across multiple applications.
2. Single Sign-On (SSO): LDAP supports SSO, allowing users to authenticate once and access multiple applications without re-entering credentials.
3. Scalability: LDAP is designed to handle a large number of users and provides efficient performance, making it suitable for applications with growing user bases.
4. Security: LDAP offers robust security features, including encryption and advanced authentication mechanisms, enhancing overall application security.
5. Integration with Enterprise Systems: LDAP integrates well with enterprise systems like Active Directory, making it a suitable choice for organizations with existing LDAP infrastructure.
   Chosen Option: Forms Authentication


## Decision Outcome
To determine the authentication mechanism for the application, we evaluated the use of Forms Authentication and LDAP.

## Justification
After careful consideration of the evaluation criteria and analyzing the pros of both options, we have decided to choose Forms Authentication as the preferred authentication mechanism for the application. The following reasons justify this decision:

Simplicity: Forms Authentication offers a simple implementation and management process within the application, reducing complexity and development effort.
Customization: The ability to customize the authentication process, password policies, and user registration aligns with the specific requirements of the application.
Flexibility: Forms Authentication supports various data sources, allowing the application to adapt to different environments and integrate with different databases.
User-Friendly: Users are familiar with the standard username/password form, resulting in a seamless and intuitive authentication experience.
Access Control: Forms Authentication integrates well with role-based authorization mechanisms, enabling fine-grained access control and permission management.
While LDAP offers benefits such as centralized management and single sign-on capabilities, Forms Authentication better aligns with the application's requirements, providing the desired balance between simplicity, customization, and user experience
